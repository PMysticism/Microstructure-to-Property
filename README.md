# Microstructure-to-Property
Cast-Forged AZ80 Magnesium Alloy Microstructure-to-Mechanical Property Prediction

This is the implementation of the microstructure-to-mechanical property prediction model. The model uses SEM images of cast-forged AZ80 magnesium alloy to predict its YS, UTS, modulus of elasticity, and Ramberg-Osgood parameters, K and n.
